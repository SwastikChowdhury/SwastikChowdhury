Your issue is caused by malformed Markdown syntax and broken badge URLs. Each badge should be a **separate image** with a **valid Shields.io URL**. Do not nest badge URLs or combine them in a single line. Here’s a clean, correct way to format your technical skills section with badges, preserving your original grouping.
